# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Installation
For milestone 3, I used a package to generated random words. To install this, run:
`pip install random-word`

## File Structure
- **Milestone_2**: Introduced the idea of randomly choosing a word from a list and validating a user input
- **Milestone_3**: Separated the code created in milestone_2 into a function and added a new function to check if the user input is the word
- **Milestone_4**: Created a Hangman class to include the two functions created in milestone_3 and added more logic to those functions

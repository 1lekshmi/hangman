# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Installation
- For milestone 3, I used a package to generated random words. To install this, run:
`pip install random-word`
- To play the game, clone this repo, move to the right directory and run `python milestone_5.py`

## File Structure
- **Milestone_2**: Introduced the idea of randomly choosing a word from a list and validating a user input
- **Milestone_3**: Separated the code created in milestone_2 into a function and added a new function to check if the user input is the word
- **Milestone_4**: Created a Hangman class to include the two functions created in milestone_3 and added more logic to those functions
- **Milestone_5**: Added a function to the code created in Milestone_4 so the user will be able to play the game. The game will stop if all the letters have been guessed correctly or if all the lives were used.

## What I learned
- Object Oriented Programming
- String manipulation, user input validation, deepend understanding of control flows
- Realised the power of creating a project in small steps

## What I achieved
- Created a fully interactive game where players tries to guess a word, which was randomly selected from a list
